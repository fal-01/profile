        <h2 class="subtitle">Experience</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="context">As a composer of music for multiple indie short films, including an award-winning film from the Las
            Vegas and Berlin film festivals, I demonstrated my ability to compose music to strict deadlines and to
            follow the brief set by the Directors. I also worked as a foley operator and did the sound mastering
            on the films I worked on. I was commissioned to write the music for several episodes of ITV’s
            popular soap operas, Coronation Street and Emmerdale. I worked to strict deadlines, followed the
            brief set by the Directors and produced music that was of the quality required for national television.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="context">As producer, director, and composer of a musical show that had a two-week run in a theatre on “The
            Mile” at the Edinburgh Fringe, I was responsible for financing and budgeting the production, casting,
            employing musicians, organising accommodation and travel requirements, scheduling rehearsals,
            technical and sound liaison, and publicity.</p>
